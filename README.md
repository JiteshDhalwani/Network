1. **New Post**: Users who are signed in should be able to write a new text-based post by filling in text into a text area and then clicking a button to submit the post. 
2. **All Posts**: The “All Posts” link in the navigation bar should take the user to a page where they can see all posts from all users, with the most recent posts first. 
3. **Profile Page**: Clicking on a username should load that user’s profile page.
4. **Following**: The “Following” link in the navigation bar should take the user to a page where they see all posts made by users that the current user follows. 
5. **Pagination**: On any page that displays posts, posts should only be displayed 10 on a page. If there are more than ten posts, a “Next” button should appear to take the user to the next page of posts (which should be older than the current page of posts). If not on the first page, a “Previous” button should appear to take the user to the previous page of posts as well. 
6. **Edit Post**: Users should be able to click an “Edit” button or link on any of their own posts to edit that post. 
7. **“Like” and “Unlike”**: Users should be able to click a button or link on any post to toggle whether or not they “like” that post.
